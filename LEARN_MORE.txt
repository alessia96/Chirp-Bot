WHAT IS CHIRP_BOT?

CHIRP_BOT is a treasure hunt platformer puzzle game based on the interaction between PC and mobile device (Android).
The main aim of the game is to solve the enigmas that the CHIRP_BOT will tell you about.
CHIRP_BOT will interact with you through its voice, based on CHIRP tunes generated through the Chirp.io API.
Each tune will be readable through the Robot Translator app (NOT YET AVAILABLE ON PLAY STORE - ASK CHIRP.IO TEAM!)
and will translate into natural language, in order for the player to get to solve the quest.
